Hello and welcome to the Table 5 Cat Sanctuary!
Here you will find a current list of all our cats which include both Organic cats and Robotic cats.

You have the ability to adopt a cat to take home with you or you have the ability to stay here and play with all of our lovely cats.  Watch out for those laser beams though!! 

*** Once a cat has been adopted it will no longer be in the shelter and therefore you will no longer be able to interact with it at the shelter.  

Activities availble at the shelter:
-Play with all cats (Decreases boredom by 2)
-Feed all organic cats (Decreases hunger by 2)
-Take organic cats to vet (Increases health by 5)
-Clean organic cats litter boxes (Decreases litterbox by 10)
-Repair robotic cats (Increases maintenance by 2)
-Recharge robotic cats (increases battery-life by 5)
-Shoot robotic cats laser beams!! (ZAP!!!)
-Adopt a cat (Adios!)

Some activities only apply to the Organic cats and some only apply to the Robotic cats.  Adopt a cat and Play with cat apply to both types.

As you play in the game time will tick by.  Keep an eye on the cats attributes to make sure they dont get too sick or hungry!

At any time a player can exit the game simply by typing "exit".

We here at the Table 5 Cat Sanctuary sincerely appreciate your valuable time.  And remember as Bob Barker would always say: "This is Table 5 reminding you to help control the pet population- have your pets spayed or neutered!"
